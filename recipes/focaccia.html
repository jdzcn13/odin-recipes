    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Focaccia. All these Italian dishes are making me hungry. I donâ€™t know when the Italians typically eat focaccia, but I assume they eat it at all the time because that is what I would do.</p>
    <p>Easy to make and even easier to eat. Give this no knead focaccia a try. I used a large cast-iron pan for this amount of ingredients.</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>All-purpose flour 360g</li>
            <li>Instant Yeast 6g</li>
            <li>Lukewarm Water 354g</li>
            <li>Salt to taste</li>
            <li>Olive Oil</li>
        </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>In a large bowl mix the flour, yeast, and salt together. Add the water and mix. Form into a sticky dough ball.</li>
            <li>Remove from fridge and place in pan lightly oiled pan that will be used for cooking.</li>
            <li>Let sit at room temperature for 2-4 hours or until it has spread out in the pan.</li>
            <li>When it is about ready, turn on your oven to preheat 220C.</li>
            <li>Once preheated, dimple the focaccia with your fingers.</li>
            <li>Place in oven and bake for 25-30 minutes.</li>
            <li>Remove and let it sit 10 minutes before cutting. Patience.</li>
        </ol>
