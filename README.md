# odin-recipes
Before Project:
This is my first TOP project. The title of it is Recipes. We have been learning the very basics of HTML so this project is supposed to demonstrate those skills. We have covered the HTML Boilerplate, head element, body element, HTML comments, links & images, ordered list, unordered list, and commit messages. This project will demonstrate that we understand these skills as well as working between our code editor, git, and git hub.

Post Project: I am sure made some mistakes in this first project but that is ok because overall I felt like I learned quite a bit. Was able to demonstrate the skills we learned during this part of the intro course. The commit messages were a bit confusing at first using them in practice. After making mistakes, reviewing, googling, I was able to move through it with better flow and upon making an error again, knowing what to do when that happened instead of having to look it up again is small progress.
