# odin-recipes
Before Project:
This is my first TOP project. The title of it is Recipes. We have been learning the very basics of HTML so this project is supposed to demonstrate those skills. We have covered the HTML Boilerplate, head element, body element, HTML comments, links & images, ordered list, unordered list, and commit messages. This project will demonstrate that we understand these skills as well as working between our code editor, git, and git hub.
